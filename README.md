# ⚖️ The Rules of How To GitHub :🔥

1. Work on your own branch. Naming convention is \<initials\>\_\<scene name\>, example: if I was working on a scene called Level1 I would name it `dm_level1`
2. One Scene One Person Policy: make sure you're the only person working on a scene. Make a scene for a feature.
3. When you've finished your feature, make a pull request and we will merge :3
